# Final-Year-Project
Devised a ML algorithm to detect Fake News as part of my under-graduate Final Year Project

With the help of Machine Learning, a distinction has been formed between Real news and Fake news, so as to prevent the spread of rumours and eventually help people to acknowledge themselves with news pieces that are genuine. Three classifiers, namely Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine have been used along with TF-IDF. These classifiers are used simultaneously to get a comparative analysis of their performance in detecting Fake news.
